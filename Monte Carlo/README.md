- A call option gives you the right (but not the obligation) to buy one (or multiple) shares of the underlying stock for a specific price — the strike price. So, if you hold a call option with a strike price of $100 and the spot price of the stock goes up to $105 you could “exercise” your option and buy the stock for $100 and immediately sell it again for $105 making a profit of $5 minus the premium paid for the option.  -
- Put options work in a similar fashion, only now we have the right (but not the obligation) to sell one (or multiple) shares of the underlying stock for a specific price. So, if you hold a put option with a strike of $100 and the price drops to $95 you could exercise your option to sell the stock short for $100 and immediately buy it back for $95; making a $5 profit minus the options premium. We can see that with put options we can make money when the market goes down.
