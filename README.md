### Binomial Option Pricing Model
- https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/021215/examples-understand-binomial-option-pricing-model.asp
- Risk-neutral method for valuing path-dependant options(can be used for American Options)
- Iterative approach - two possible outcomes with each iteration- a move up or a move down that follows a binomial tree
- In a binomial tree model, the underlying asset can only be worth exactly one of two possible values, which is not realistic, as assets can be worth any number of values within any given range.
